# Assignment 1

If you have any questions, please contact me at [2053932@tongji.edu.cn].

This assignment consists of three mathematical proof questions and three programming questions.

### File Structure

``` bash
.
├── hw1.pdf
├── README.md
├── code
│   ├── Q4
│   ├── Q5
│   └── Q6
└── requirements.txt
```

The solutions to the proof questions can be found in `hw1.pdf`.

Code for programming questions can be found in the "code" folder. The results are located in the "Qx/src/result" or "Qx/images/result"(for C++) folder, where "x" corresponds to the question number. 

## Environment

- **Operating System:** macOS Monterey 12.5.1 (21G83)
- **Development Tool:** Visual Studio Code (vscode) Version 1.83.1
- **Python Version:** 3.10.12
- **C++ Compiler:** Apple clang version 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)
- **OpenCV Version:** Stable 4.8.1 (Installed via Homebrew)

To install Python dependencies if needed, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Q4

### How to run

```bash
cd /Users/lei/Desktop/CV/hw/hw1/code/Q4 # change the path 

python main.py
```

### Result

The following figure is the result of using RANSAC algorithm to fit discrete points.

## Q5

The origin images come from [here](https://github.com/csLinZhang/CVBook/tree/main/chapter-04-feature%20detection%20and%20matching/03-openSIFTVS)

### How to run

```bash
cd /Users/lei/Desktop/CV/hw/hw1/code/Q5 # change the path

python main.py
```

### Result

The following are the feature point detection results of the two graphs.

![sse2_keypoints](https://lei-1306809548.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/Obsidian/sse2_keypoints.png)

The matching results are shown below.

I have also produced the result of "the left image remains unchanged while the right image is transformed," as shown in the following image.

## Q6

The origin images come from [here](https://github.com/csLinZhang/CVBook/tree/main/chapter-04-feature%20detection%20and%20matching/03-openSIFTVS)

### How to run

```bash
cd /Users/lei/Desktop/CV/hw/hw1/code/Q6 # change the path

mkdir build  # for cmake

cd build

cmake ..  # generate makefile

make  # compile

./main  # run
```

You may need `make clean` to clean up the files generated by the compilation.

### Result

The matching results are shown below.

![image_matches](https://lei-1306809548.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/Obsidian/image_matches.png)

The following image shows the panoramic stitching result of "the left image transformed while the right image remains unchanged."
